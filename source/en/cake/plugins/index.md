Cake integrates additional features through plugins, and does not itself contain any files with additional features. So lightweight and powerful. And you can also use NexT's plugin, go to [Awesome NexT](https://github.com/theme-next/awesome-next) to see more plugins

# List

The following are the plugins I have written, most of which are the original integrated functions of NexT, which I went out independently （＃￣～￣＃）

- [hexo-cake-canvas-ribbon](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-cake-canvas-ribbon): Ribbon background
- [hexo-cake-math](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-cake-math): Math Support
- [hexo-cake-moon-menu](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-cake-moon-menu): New lower right button (read progress and return to top button)
- [hexo-cake-local-search](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-cake-local-search): Local search function
- [hexo-cake-google-analytics](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-cake-google-analytics): Google Analytics for cake theme

Some other plugins may be helpful for you to use hexo
- [hexo-netlify-cms](https://github.com/jiangtj/hexo-netlify-cms): Simplify the use of Netlify CMS (an online content editor)
- [hexo-theme-plus](https://github.com/jiangtj/hexo-theme-plus): Designed to externally replace the layout files inside the theme

Some examples, if you want to write your own plugin, you can refer to
- [hexo-cake-live2d](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-cake-live2d): Live2d support (different from upstream: only the Html files generated by Cake are not all)
- [hexo-next-article-anchor](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-next-article-anchor): Page title anchor
- [hexo-next-wapper-tag-cloud](https://github.com/jiangtj-lab/hexo-next-wapper-tag-cloud): Encapsulate the hexo-tag-cloud plugin

# Use

```bash
# use npm
npm i <plugin-name>(example:hexo-cake-canvas-ribbon) --save
# or use yarn
yarn add <plugin-name>(example:hexo-cake-canvas-ribbon)
```

The Cake plugin is very easy to install, just like the normal hexo plugin, the only difference is that it works on NexT or Cake themes ([or other use injector2 plugin](https://github.com/jiangtj/hexo-extend-injector2)).

Other themes, if the user wants to use, please goto [hexo-extend-injector2](https://github.com/jiangtj/hexo-extend-injector2).
